### Updated FAQ Content

**Q1: What tokens does Clips support?**
A: "Every SPL token on Solana. If it trades on Raydium, Jupiter, Orca, or any Solana DEX, Clips can replay it -- memecoins, DeFi tokens, all of them."

**Q2: How do I find my transaction hashes?**
A: "Open your wallet (Phantom, Solflare, etc.) or go to Solscan.io. Find the buy transaction and the sell transaction for your trade. Copy the transaction signature (the long string of characters) for each. That's all Clips needs."

**Q3: How long does rendering take?**
A: "Most clips render in under a minute. Pro users get priority in the queue, so your clips render first."
*(Removed "30 seconds" claim and "4K" reference to avoid unverified claims)*

**Q4: Can I share my clips on Twitter/X?**
A: "Yes. After downloading your clip, you can share it anywhere -- Twitter, Discord, Telegram, or embed it in a thread. The share button pre-fills a tweet with your P&L and a link."

**Q5: What happens when I hit my free limit?**
A: "Free users get 5 renders per month. After that, you can upgrade to Pro for unlimited clips, or wait for next month's reset."

**Q6: Can I cancel my Pro subscription?**
A: "Anytime. One click from your dashboard. You'll keep Pro access until the end of your billing period. No questions asked."

**Q7: Is my data secure?**
A: "We only use your transaction hashes to fetch public on-chain data. We never access your wallet, private keys, or funds. Your data is encrypted and stored securely on Supabase."

**Q8: Do I need to be recording my screen during the trade?**
A: "No -- that's the whole point. Clips works retroactively. Trade first, paste your hashes after, and we reconstruct the chart replay from on-chain data. No setup, no recording software."
*(New FAQ that addresses the core differentiator)*
